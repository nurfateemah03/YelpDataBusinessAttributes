# Predicting Business Attributes from Textual Data
This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict business attributes based on textual data from tips and reviews. The project is implemented using Python, and it leverages the power of Pandas and NumPy libraries for data manipulation and analysis.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict distinct business attributes based on textual data. The steps involved in this project include:

Data Collection: Gather the necessary data from relevant sources, such as a dataset containing tips and reviews related to businesses.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the collected data by removing irrelevant information, handling missing values, and performing text preprocessing tasks like tokenization, removing stop words, and applying stemming or lemmatization techniques.

Feature Engineering: Transform the preprocessed textual data into a suitable numerical representation that machine learning algorithms can understand. This step may involve techniques like vectorization, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), or word embeddings.

Model Training: Split the data into training and testing sets. Train machine learning models using the training data, such as LinearSVC, RandomForest, or Logistic Regression, to predict the desired business attributes.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. Analyze the performance of different models and select the best-performing one.

Model Deployment: Deploy the selected model to make predictions on new, unseen data. This could involve creating a user interface or integrating the model into an application.

# Required Libraries
This project relies on the following Python libraries:

pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: Used for numerical operations and array handling.
scikit-learn: Used for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
nltk: Used for natural language processing tasks, such as tokenization and stemming/lemmatization.
Please ensure that these libraries are installed in your Python environment before running the project.


# Usage
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository to your local machine.

Install the required libraries listed in the requirements.txt file using the following command:
